# NinjaOne plugin — governance and safety model

Unofficial. Community-built plugin for the NinjaOne (NinjaRMM) API. Not
affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by the vendor.

## What it connects as

This plugin does not hold credentials. It reaches NinjaOne through the
WYRE Conduit gateway (`https://conduit.wyre.ai/v1/mcp`), which brokers
authentication centrally and scopes every call to the tenant the operator
is authorised for.

The plugin is published as `ninjaone-rmm`; Conduit's vendor slug is
`ninjaone`, which is the key to look under in `VENDOR_TOOL_CONFIG` and
the prefix every tool name carries.

Consequences worth stating plainly:

- No NinjaOne client ID or client secret is stored on the technician's
  machine, in this repo, or in the model's context.
- The org's NinjaOne credential is stored once at the gateway, so
  replacing it is one edit rather than a change on every technician's
  machine. There is no rotate action, though — you re-submit the
  connect form, which overwrites the stored credential in place, and
  nothing tracks its age or prompts you.

- Every call carries operator identity, so Conduit's audit log answers
  "who rebooted that server" — NinjaOne's own activity log records only
  the API application. The log records *who called what*, never with what
  arguments, so it will name `ninjaone_devices_reboot` but not the device.
- Removing a technician's Conduit org membership stops their NinjaOne
  access on their next call, because membership is re-read per request.
  It does **not** revoke an already-issued token, and it does not touch
  credentials they connected personally. Full offboarding is more than
  one step — see `wyre-gateway/GOVERNANCE.md`, *Revocation*.

## Tool permission groups

Grouped into the four buckets Conduit's access editor presents, with the
tier each bucket actually enforces at.

| Group | What it can do | Enforcement tier | Tools |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Read** | Cannot change NinjaOne or endpoint state. Safe for autonomous agents. | `read` | `ninjaone_status`, `ninjaone_navigate`, `ninjaone_devices_list`, `ninjaone_devices_get`, `ninjaone_devices_alerts`, `ninjaone_devices_activities`, `ninjaone_devices_services`, `ninjaone_devices_get_custom_fields`, `ninjaone_organizations_list`, `ninjaone_organizations_get`, `ninjaone_organizations_devices`, `ninjaone_organizations_locations`, `ninjaone_organizations_get_custom_fields`, `ninjaone_alerts_get`, `ninjaone_alerts_list`, `ninjaone_alerts_summary`, `ninjaone_tickets_list`, `ninjaone_tickets_get`, `ninjaone_tickets_comments`, `ninjaone_tickets_boards_list` |
| **Write** | Creates or modifies records — **and reboots customer machines.** | `write` | `ninjaone_organizations_create`, `ninjaone_organizations_update_custom_fields`, `ninjaone_tickets_create`, `ninjaone_tickets_update`, `ninjaone_tickets_add_comment`, `ninjaone_alerts_reset`, `ninjaone_alerts_reset_all`, `ninjaone_devices_reboot`, `ninjaone_devices_update_custom_fields` |
| **Delete** | — | `write` — **not** a tier of its own | **Empty.** No NinjaOne tool name carries a delete-verb token. |
| **Admin** | — | `admin` | **Empty.** No tool in this plugin is classified `admin` here. `ninjaone_alerts_get` is `read` above, but `VENDOR_TOOL_CONFIG` still has no entry for it — see below. |

### Read this row twice: `write` includes reboot

`ninjaone_devices_reboot` is classified `isWrite: true` with no
`isAdmin` flag, so it enforces at tier `write`. **A technician or agent
granted `write` on NinjaOne can reboot any device in any organisation
that credential can reach**, with no further gate, no confirmation, and
no approval step. The same grant carries `ninjaone_alerts_reset_all`.

That is the mechanical answer. The risk answer is different, and worth
keeping in view when you configure the grant:

- **`ninjaone_devices_reboot` is the sharpest tool in this plugin.** Its
  blast radius is not a NinjaOne record — it is the customer's running
  machine. An unsaved document, an in-flight database write, or a server
  mid-backup all lose. There is no "undo reboot", and the endpoint is
  unreachable for the minutes that follow, which is exactly when a
  technician will assume the agent broke something else. Judged by blast
  radius it belongs with `datto_run_quickjob` and
  `cwautomate_scripts_execute`, both of which Conduit pins to `admin`.
  It is not pinned, and the reviewer of this document should treat that
  as the open question rather than as settled.
- **`ninjaone_alerts_reset_all` accepts `organization_id`** and clears
  every matching alert for an entire client at once, with no undo. The
  alert queue is the monitoring evidence — an agent that clears it to
  "tidy up" has erased the signal that a real outage is in progress, and
  NinjaOne will not regenerate an alert until the underlying condition
  next re-triggers. It, too, enforces at `write`.

Because the Admin group is empty, there is no tier above `write` that
separates ticket comments from machine reboots. **If you need an agent
that can update tickets but not reboot endpoints, a tier grant cannot
express it.** Use a granular per-tool selection, which compiles to an
explicit `customTools` allowlist
(`src/access/tier-group-mapping.ts`), and omit
`ninjaone_devices_reboot` and `ninjaone_alerts_reset_all` from it. That
allowlist is the only mechanism Conduit offers here.

### Where the table and `VENDOR_TOOL_CONFIG` disagree

The NinjaOne MCP server registers 29 tools at `v2.3.1`, and the table
above classifies all 29. `VENDOR_TOOL_CONFIG`
(`src/proxy/result-cache.ts`) was written against a 25-tool surface and
classifies 24 of those, so it lags the table in two ways. It has no
entry for **`ninjaone_alerts_get`** — a single-alert read — and none for
the four `*_custom_fields` tools, which postdate it:
`ninjaone_devices_get_custom_fields`,
`ninjaone_devices_update_custom_fields`,
`ninjaone_organizations_get_custom_fields` and
`ninjaone_organizations_update_custom_fields`. Two of those four write.

The table is the tier documentation; `VENDOR_TOOL_CONFIG` is what
Conduit enforces on. Where a deployment routes through Conduit, its
classification is fail-closed and the enforcement gate coerces an
unclassified tool to the highest tier:
`const requiredTier: PermissionTier = classified ?? 'admin';`
(`src/access/access-enforcement.ts:63`). So on such a deployment a
`read`-tier agent can call `ninjaone_alerts_list` and
`ninjaone_alerts_summary` but is denied `ninjaone_alerts_get`, and every
one of the four `*_custom_fields` tools requires `admin` — including the
two that only read. That is a classification gap rather than a policy
decision, and closing it in `VENDOR_TOOL_CONFIG` to match the table
above is a privilege reduction on the reads and a privilege *grant* on
the two writes, which is why the two documents are reconciled
deliberately rather than by copying one into the other.

`ninjaone_navigate` is classified `read` but is refused for *every*
caller at *every* tier, org owners included: Conduit suppresses
`*_navigate` and `*_back` unconditionally before any tier check
(`src/proxy/tool-call-enforcement.ts:125-130`,
`src/proxy/discovery-tools.ts:41-50`). Use `conduit__my_access`.

### What granting `write` means generally

Conduit's enforcement tiers are only `read`, `write`, and `admin` (plus
`none`, meaning deny) — `src/access/permission-tier.ts:27`. "Delete" is a
presentation group in the access editor, and a delete-group tool compiles
to and enforces at tier `write` (`src/access/tier-group-mapping.ts`,
`GROUP_ENFORCEMENT_TIER`). **Granting a technician `write` for a vendor
also grants every delete tool on it.** NinjaOne's Delete group happens to
be empty — no tool name here carries `delete`, `remove`, `dismiss`, or
`archive` (`src/access/tool-naming.ts:136`) — but that is cold comfort
when the destructive capability in this plugin is called `reboot` and
sits in Write instead.

Conduit has no approval step, no per-call confirmation, and no
interactive prompt. It compares tiers. The per-call approval discipline
below is a workflow you impose on your agents, and it is only as good as
the agent configuration that carries it.

## Recommended agent policy

The safe default is **read autonomously, propose writes, never
self-approve deletes.**

- Read tools: allow. Device-health sweeps, patch-compliance reporting, and
  cross-organization alert triage are the intended autonomous use, and are
  what the bundled `device-health-auditor` and `patch-compliance-reporter`
  subagents do.
- Write tools: agent drafts the exact call, human approves, then it runs.
  Ticket writes are visible to the customer if the board emails on update.
- **Do not grant plain `write` to a scheduled or unattended agent.** For
  NinjaOne that grant includes `ninjaone_devices_reboot` and
  `ninjaone_alerts_reset_all`, and no part of Conduit will ask before
  either runs. Unattended agents should hold a granular grant whose
  `customTools` lists only the record-writing tools they need. Use a
  service client rather than a human's token — it can never inherit
  owner bypass.
- For a human-driven reboot: name an approver per invocation and confirm
  `offline: false` first. Conduit will not prompt.

## What it cannot reach

- Only the NinjaOne organizations the connected credential can reach, and
  only within the NinjaOne region (US/EU/CA/OC) that credential was
  issued for. NinjaOne instances are region-partitioned; one credential
  does not see another region's devices. Conduit controls *who in your
  organisation may use that credential and which tools they may call*,
  not which slice of NinjaOne's data comes back — scope the credential at
  NinjaOne if you need a narrower boundary.
- No filesystem, no shell, no other vendor's data.
- **No script or command execution.** NinjaOne's platform supports running
  scripts and automations against endpoints; no tool in this plugin
  exposes that. `ninjaone_devices_services` lists Windows services — it
  cannot start, stop, or restart them.
- No policy editing, no patch approval, no agent deployment or uninstall.
- No arbitrary-request passthrough. There is no `ninjaone_raw_request`,
  `ninjaone_execute_tool`, or `ninjaone_router`, so nothing in this
  surface has a blast radius chosen by its arguments.
- No live event stream. Every tool is point-in-time; NinjaOne webhooks
  carry the push feed.

## Data handling

- Responses pass through Conduit into model context for the session
  and are not persisted by this plugin.
- `ninjaone_devices_get` and `ninjaone_devices_list` return endpoint
  inventory — hostnames, logged-in user names, OS build, IP and MAC
  addresses. That is client infrastructure detail and, via the last
  logged-in user, employee PII. Both are classified `read`.
- `ninjaone_tickets_get` and `ninjaone_tickets_comments` return whatever
  the requester typed, which routinely includes end-user contact details
  and occasionally credentials pasted into a ticket body.
- `ninjaone_devices_activities` is the per-device audit trail; treat it as
  evidence, and do not let an agent summarise it destructively. Note that
  Conduit classifies it `read`, unlike the equivalent audit-log read in
  some other vendors, which are pinned to `admin`.

## Known sharp edges

- **Offline devices fail late, not early.** Control calls against an
  offline endpoint return 409 rather than a clear "device is offline"
  message. Always confirm `offline: false` before a reboot; an agent that
  retries a 409 will simply queue the same failure.
- **`FORCED` reboot skips the user warning.** Where the API exposes a
  reboot mode, `NORMAL` notifies the logged-in user and `FORCED` does not.
  Default to `NORMAL`; `FORCED` is a data-loss decision, not a speed
  optimisation. Conduit cannot see the argument, so nothing outside your
  agent's own configuration enforces that default.
- **Dismissing an alert does not resolve the condition.** Conditions
  persist independently. An agent that clears alerts to make a dashboard
  look green has changed nothing about the customer's disk still being
  full.
- **Organization creation is not reversible here.** There is no delete
  tool for organizations, so a mistyped `ninjaone_organizations_create`
  leaves a permanent empty client record that has to be cleaned up in the
  NinjaOne console.
- **Rate limits degrade mid-task.** Large cross-organization sweeps will
  hit 429 partway through and return partial data. Treat a truncated sweep
  as incomplete rather than as "no further devices found".
